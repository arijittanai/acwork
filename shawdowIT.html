                <h5>Context</h5>
                <p>
                  We build a Shadow IT service which is part of digital risk platform for our customer CONTOSO. That gives all the information about the IT risks, assessment, planning and monitoring through a single platform.
                </p>
				
                <h5>Problem Statement</h5>
                <p>
			     Employees/Users sometimes are so engrossed in their work or finishing up a specific task that unknowingly they might download an unauthorized software or app and as a result they invite an unwanted threat to them and their organization. It could be a virus, a data breach, or other cyber threats that could attack a well-functioning team, organization or individual.
                </p>
				<h5>Solution</h5>
                <p>
                The solution is a based on IT team's attentiveness. So that the IT team can get to know what kind
				of unauthorised tools or files are downloaded by the employees and how can they make it more secure
				by accessing the threat and help employees make their work easier and faster. </br>  </br>The solution will allow employees to experiment with new tools while mitigating 
				Shadow IT risks and provide a competitive advantage.

                <h5><b>Understand the space</b></h5>
                <p>To clarify existing shortcomings, I needed to better understand entire ecosystem 
				of risk management platform, what is the existing behavour of the user while using 
				current system, how they do assessment and implement the controls. I did this through:
                </p>
				<h5>1. Domain Study - Shadow IT process</h5>
                <p>Employees/Users sometimes are so engrossed in their work or finishing up a 
				specific task that unknowingly they might download an unauthorized software 
				or app and as a result they invite an unwanted threat to them and their organization. 
				It could be a virus, a data breach, or other cyber threats that could attack a well-functioning team,
				organization or individual.
                </p>
				<h5>2. Understanding customer existing system</h5>                
                <p>To empathise users and understanding their existing pain points, we did virtual workshop with 
				users from different profile groups, asked them to perform some predefined tasks and we 
				were noted down the obeservations.</p>			
				<ul class="list-unstyled">
                        <li><strong>Key insights:</strong></li>
                        <li>- Overwhelming data - User specific data is desired </li>
                        <li>- For employee, its very hard to understand & identify their incident which has converted into a problem.</li>
                        <li>- The information hierarchy is not so good. Everything looks equally important.</li>
                        <li>- The flows are very confusing.</li>
                        <li>- There are multiple ways to perform a task. But, none of them are proving a good experience.</li>
                      </ul>
				 				
				<h5>3. User surveys analysis</h5>
                <p>
               Stakeholder did survey of government and corporate 
			   office workers in Boston and Washington, D.C. to gather anonymous selfreports 
			   of work-related security behaviors and attitudes.</br></br>
			   One insight <b>we learned was that as per study reported that 
			   35 percent of employees feel like they need to work around 
			   their company's security policies just to get their job done.</b> 
			   Which encouraged me to continue thinking of rest 65% employee, 
			   how we are empowering them to use their preferred tools can 
			   deliver long-term benefits with the help of shadow IT under company security policies.
				 </p>
				
				<h5>4. App analysis</h5>
                <p>
               ​I played with many existing homework (or related) apps from the 
			   Internet to learn from what's already been done. To know and 
			   understand the strengths and weaknesses of our competition, 
			   I did heuristic evalution 5 topmost apps. Also look at some patterns 
			   that shaped my design thinking included use of color for class hierarchy 
			   and typography to emphasize the most crucial information, the assignment due date.

				<h5>Business thoughts about existing system</h5>

              From the research findings, I mapped employee shawdow IT lifecycle through 
			  identify, assessment, risk type/risk rating, control and monitoring 
			  to better understand the employee and shawdow IT process flows.

            <p>
              We started out experimenting with CONTOSO brand guildeline and his 
			  three different internal products the system would be applied to — discovering, 
			  establishing and stress testing a style(s) and library of components and patterns. 
			  The direction, user interface (UI) and style changed over time, which I’ve attempted 
			  to capture below to show the progression and the range of products tested.
