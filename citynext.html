                <p>
                  The city of Woden Valley, Australia has an operations center that focuses on citizens and 
				  how technology and innovation can support their everyday lives while seamlessly 
				  collecting data that can be monitored over time on devices and services platform. </p>
				
                <h5>Problem Statement</h5>
                <p>Citizena are facing an era, when it's getting more and more important to address enviromental 
				concerns such as climate change, pollution or over population. <strong>By 2050, more than 60% of 
				the world's population is expected to live in cities.</strong></p>
				<h5>Solution</h5>
                <p>
                Our approach to the information systems and communication technologies 
				we can incresae sustainbility. These solutions could be beneficial for both the citizens, the goverment and the enviroment.
				</br></br>
				CityNext apps, help to see the live enviromental data of your city, provided by sensors. 
				Public can monitor the various enviromental attributes and get real time notifications about the possible dangers. 
				The apps provides a direct connection between the public and the information system of the city.

				<h5>How technology can this be helpful?</h5>				
                <p>The machine learning and big data solutions could be one approach to 
				improve and optimize the life in cities. A smart city usually 
				is an urban area the uses various types of electronic data, collected by (mostly) 
				sensors. The data will get structured in order for machine learning algorithm. 
				This algorithm identifies patterns and learns from them.				
				With that information, the goverment can manage assets and resources in an efficient and 
				sustainable way to maximize the healthy growth of the city. It would be capable of 
				predicting possible anomalies and enviromental changes. Beside that, the 
				government could get a clear view of the life and development of the city.

			  customer base? How the application should behave? Once I had the information structure 
			  and the user journey, I created some early paper wireframe, to teat my idea and to limit
			  the capabilities and functions of the whole system. When I was satisfied with the package, 
			  I built the digital wireframes too.
