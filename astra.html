                <h5>Context</h5>
                <p>
                  This was the pilot project for our customer Astra International in collaboration with 
				  Astra automotive division and Microsoft consulting team. <strong>As a designer 
				  I was closely worked with Product Manager and UX researcher in this project and in charge of 
				  leading all aspects of the user experience for Mobile (persona creation, Future journey map, interaction, prototyping, validation).</strong>
                </p></br>
				
                <h5>Problem Statement</h5>
                <p>
			     Astra received a significant number of enquiries and sales prospects, 
				 however, due to lack of an integrated sales process and approach, 
				 they were unable to convert the prospects into sales. This was 
				 leading to downfall in business.
                </p></br>
				<h5>Solution</h5>
                <p>
                How can we <strong>Increase the Astra automotive sales and improve the customer engagement 
				through an Intergrated digital platform </strong>so that our customers can explore 
				the information easily.

				 <h5><strong>What does the car buying experience look like?</strong></h5>
                <p>
			     Owning a car is a considerable investment for average households, so it can be both a 
				 special moment and a daunting process when you decide to get a car for the first time.</br></br>
				 
				 From our user research, we learned that car buyer spend around 3 to 4 months in average researching cars online. Some even take up to one year to make a decision.
				 Besides, 6 out of 10 car buyers enter the market, unsure which car to buy — many start by consulting from reliable sources to narrow their choices. Still, many factors of the experience are broken and confusing to buyers.
                 One example is the information likes packages, pricing and inventory; they are often inconsistent across different sites. <strong>Shoppers are blurred by a multitude of factors: sticker price, 
                 internet price, invoice price, sales price, and a host of incentives they may not even qualify for.</strong></br></br> There is also about the trust relationship between shoppers and dealers. 
				 For instance, shoppers nowadays are accustomed to comparing prices and expect transparency. Yet, counter-intuitively, they still want to negotiate the price because they don’t trust flat-rate pricing.
				 
				 After all of that, the shopper is happy to get a deal, but the car financing is intricately intertwined with the purchase, 
				 they start struggling with paperwork, finance and loan process. <strong>According to an Autotrader study, 
				 only 17 out of 4,000 shoppers described the car buying process as their ideal experience.</strong>

			<h5> Checklist & Tracking</h5>
            <p>Once the decision of buying a particular product is made by the customer, 
			then the question comes of what do I need to get the car. To answer that we 
			came up with the Checklist which creates transperancy between buyer and the 
			seller. Also, it works as a progress metric.</p>

			<h5>Total Cost of Ownership</h5>
            <p>Once the decision is made, and the documents and leaglities are in progress, 
			custmores are worried about the exaxct cost of ownership. The questions comes 
			like what will be my future liability, how much do I have to spend? Then 
			we came up with the TCO feature which guess the best cost as per the usage.</p>

			<h5>Community</h5>
            <p>In research we found that in most of the car showrooms the process of 
			selling a car was manual or by plain messaging. Which in result was a loss 
			and a disappointment for the customers as well. We saw a great potential there 
			to improve the situation and we created tools for Salesperson. We came up with 
			the idea of empowering sales people with dashboard where they could see the 
			existing cutomer profile status and their needs.</p>
