                <h5>Context</h5>
                <p>It was my design assignment project. In this project I was did ux research, personas, storyboarding to final design.</p>
				
				 <h5>The Challenge</h5>
                <p>Design a flow demonstrating the experience of an outside seller 
				getting ready for his upcoming working day using Outlook calendar,
				but not restricting to what it provides. The goal is to enrich the 
				current experience and make it more tailored for outside sellers.</p>
				
				<h5>Goal</h5>
                <p>
                 - To design a Calendar app well suited for Outside Sellers.</br>
                 - To demonstrate the understanding of the Interaction & Visual Design</br>
                 - To showcase the design process

                <h5>Research</h5>
                <p>A brief research was done to understand the outside sellers life in a day and to determine the problems 
				they face. In the process I interviewed few sellers from Microsoft GD to gather the information around 
				the tasks these sellers perform, their needs, expectations and what drives their motivation; 
				I also analyzed  the scope of calendar as a tool in a sellers life. In addition, 
				I also assessed the competitors market positioning and analyzed their website 
				functionalities/features; which really helped me identify the key points and gaps 
				and what difficulties the users face when they use a calendar app. A small empathy 
				research was also don over a call with couple of sellers. </p>

                Synthesizing User Research: From the research findings, participants inputs from interviews, secondary research data were analyzed to
				identify similarities/patterns in user behavior and preference.A persona was built that resonates with their goals, 
				needs and frustrations. A back-story for the persona was created to resemble interviewees lifestyle. 
				Following which an empathy map was developed using patterns observed from inputs provided by participants 
				from contextual inquiry. Two of the most observed pain points from the research data were chosen as 
				underlying problem to create a scenario for storyboard. It was observed that the seller  participants were 
				hesitant to cancel the meetings and setting up a new meeting with a short notice. The story depicts a 
				situation where the persona ‘Paula’ would face a similar problem and how using the designed calendar 
				app would help her overcome her difficulties at work.

			A low fidelity wireframe was designed using Adobe XD for important pages. 
			Subsequently pages were later developed to complete task flow. Storyline is
