                <h5>Context</h5>
                <p> Club Samsung launched in 2014, it serves as a one stop entertainment hub for 
				Samsung India audience serving up content such as Live Tv, Movies, Music & 
				Live Events. It's USP is to give users Bollywood & Regional entertainment on 
				the go. I was a part of the previous design team, where I had worked on the research, 
				Interaction design and visual design of the Mobile, Tablet and TV App.</br></br>
                <strong>Planned was re-design Club Samsung's Entertainment app </strong>for Samsung store 
				solved many problems that had manifested over the years.
				It aimed to modernize music app by bringing new features which 
				makes more interesting and connecting to the music lovers. It is 
				also helped influence its future direction.
                </p></br>
				
                <h5>Problem Statement</h5>
				<p> Our research team identified 4 primary problems with the first version of the app.</p>

					<h5>1. Performance</h5>
                      App was slow to load when compared to other apps, and user were bouncing. They expected the app to be as fast as mobile, if not faster.
                    </div></br>
                       <div class="mb-3">

                      The app does a good job playing its playlists but it does not give me interactive playful experinece to discove new music.
                    </div></br>
                    <div class="mb-3"></br>

                     User felt there are too many features and content and the app feels bloated at times. 
					 Though the visuals were edgy user feels a little too big and as a result make screen looks heavy.

                <p>I started the project with 4 above goal: to see how people are currently 
				sharing music with each other and  I needed to make sure the new feature 
				would integrate seamlessly to the Club Samsung could make that process better. 
				Since I didn't yet have a problem to solve for, I then conducted some competitor 
				analysis to see what features they had and if they had any similar features. 
				I also wanted to get a sense of their UX and see how we could do better. 
				I created a research plan and interview guide and found 4 different types 
				of music listeners to interview to find out:
				<ul class="list-unstyled">
                        <li>-  What sharing music means to user</li>
                        <li>-  How, why, and when they share music</li>
                        <li>-  What frustrates them about the process currently</li>
						<li>-  Listeners are open to others’ options in terms of making playlists.</li>
						<li>-  Most people are satisfied with music collaborations as both listener and contributor.</li>
						<li>-  Most people choose music based on their current mood. (fitness, walking, yoga, relaxing, etc)</li>
                        </ul>

			<h5> <strong>Final Design </strong></h5>
            <p> After making the wireframes, I decided to see how the screens look when rendered out in colors. My focus was using neon accent colors for emphasis on a dark background, and letting the album arts take up prime foucs. The neon colors were deliberately kept close to Club Samung logo colors for relatability.</p></br>
